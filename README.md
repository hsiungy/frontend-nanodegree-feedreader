# Project Overview

I used Jasmine to write test suites against a pre-existing application given to me by Udacity. The four suites test functionality for RSS feeds, the menu, initial entries to the feed, and new feed selection.


## How to Run Application
1. Open up `index.html` in your favorite browser to run the application.

2. Details about the tests I wrote will be displayed at the bottom of the page. All 7 specs should pass.
